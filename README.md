# Advent of Code 2021

[![CI](https://github.com/zargony/advent-of-code-2021/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zargony/advent-of-code-2021/actions)

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles, written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org).

My main goal is not to create the quickest / shortest / fastest solution ever, but to create nice, idiomatic, readable and maintainable Rust code with suitable performance.
